== Python Interpreter Model

   * Compiler - translates programs from one language to another
     language

   * Python's compiler converts Python programs into byte code
     instructions

   * Python interpreter executes the byte code instructions

   * Python interpreter is modelled after microprocessors

== Python Interpreter Model (2)

  * Python objects are stored in a heap memory

  * Python interpreter creates, modifies and destroys objects in the
    heap based on instrunctions in the byte code.

== Stack Machine

  * Interpreters can be classified into types on how the operands /
    results are stored:
    - Register Machines
    - Stack Machines

  * Demostrate a hypothetical Stack Machine with an example.

Execution of the instructions is shown in the following diagram:

== Python's Stack Machine

  * Python uses the Stack Machine approach

  * Internal stack is a temporary area that contains pointers to
    Python objects in the heap.

  * Instructions push and pop data on to the stack.
